Immortals movie coming out on 11-11-11 = 33.  Significance of the Immortals movie story from Wikipedia:  Before the dawn of man and beast, Immortals waged war against each other in Heaven. The victors declared themselves gods while the vanquished were renamed the Titans and imprisoned beneath Mount Tartarus(a Greek version of Hell/Hades). The Epirus Bow, a weapon of immense power, was lost on Earth during the war...the story here is complex involving Zeus, Athena, Apollo, etc. A Christian analogy can be made between
a God (in this stories case gods) in power and the Titans who lost the early battle and are imprisoned in Tartarus (Hell/Hades). An anti-christ like figure named Hyperion uses the Epirus Bow to storm Mount Tartarus and free the imprisoned Titans. (one could draw an analogy here to the imprisoned Satan)<br>

A place where the KJV and New International version differ<br>
Isaiah 14:12 - Major mistake in the International version of Isaiah 14:12.<br>
King James Version of Isaiah 14:12 is correct.<br><br>
International:<br>
How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!<br>
King James Version (this is the correct version because Jesus is the Morning Star:<br>
How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!<br>
